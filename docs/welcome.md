## Getting started

When you first join you will spawn on the Hub server. Right-click the compass in your hand to open the server switcher.

You can open this menu at any time by typing `/game`, or go directly to the server:

- `/hub`
- `/survival`
- `/creative`
- `/paintball`

## Survival

The [Survival](/gamemodes/survival) gamemode offers a semi-vanilla experience, improving your experience without changing gameplay too much.

## Creative

In creative, each play gets 1 or more large (101*101) flat plots. You can use this space to design your Survival base, test redstone, or just be creative.
See [creative plots](/gamemodes/creative) for information

## Paintball

A fun minigame that replaced Zombies. See [paintball minigame](/gamemodes/paintball).
