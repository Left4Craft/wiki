## Getting started

When you first join you will spawn on the Hub server. Right-click the compass in your hand to open the server switcher.

You can open this menu at any time by typing `/game`, or go directly to the server:

- `/hub`
- `/survival`
- `/creative`
- `/partygames`

## Survival

The [Survival](/gamemodes/survival) gamemode offers a semi-vanilla experience, improving your experience without changing gameplay too much.

## Creative

In Creative, each player gets a large (101*101) flat plot. You can use this space to design your Survival base, test redstone, or just be creative.
See [creative plots](/gamemodes/creative) for information.

## Partygames

Have fun with 3 or more friends in Partygames, Left4Craft's unique collection of small minigames. See [Partygames](/gamemodes/partygames).
