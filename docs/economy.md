The server makes use of an dynamic economy plugin, that allows players to sell and buy items, check costs, mantain a balance, and pay other players. Players start with $500 as starter money. Players can earn more money by [voting](https://www.left4craft.org/vote/), selling items, or participating in [count to a million](https://discord.com/channels/424571587413540874/779454172826697728) on the L4C discord server.
